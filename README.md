Implementing Gossip and Push Sum Algorithm

## Team Members
Nishant Agarwal (UFID:61991874) and Moulik Agarwal (UFID:3982674)

## What is Working
We have successfully implemented the `Gossip` and `Push-Sum` Algorithm over Topologies
```1) Full Network
2) Line Network
3) 2D Grid Network
4) Imperfect 2D Network
```

By successfull implemetation we imply that the network converges (according to the definition of the algorithm) for the provided number of nodes in the network.

## Nodes Convergence Details
Below is the tabular representation of the results obtained :

|                       | Full Topology | Line Topology | 2D Topology  | Imp 2D Topology |
| ------------------    |:-------------:| -------------:| ------------:|----------------:|
| Gossip Algorithm      | `20000`       |   `20000`     | `20000`      |    `20000`      |   
| Push - Sum Algorithm  | `10000`       |   `10000`     |   `10000`    |    `10000`      |
